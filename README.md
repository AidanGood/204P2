mouserecursion.py and mousestack.py Author: Aidan Good

Project focusing on creating different algorithms to solve any maze.
Features three pre-defined maze files, or the user can request a randomly generated maze.
Algorithms based off:
  1. recurssion to find all possible exits
  2. Depth First Search approach utilizing a self-made Stack ADT to find an exit

Run testmouse.py to see test the algorithms.
